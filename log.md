# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed some basics of Java.

**Thoughts:** I feel so much better just taking a look at the basics of Java again. I'd forgotten how to structure a program and even the syntax. I've spent so long learning about concepts rather than applying them, it's good to get back to actually coding out ideas and seeing things happen.

### Day 2: February 29, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Discovered Freecodecamp Frontend development path - started first part

**Thoughts:** This is great. I finally have a place to start and it's a clear path which was what I was struggling to carve out for myself.
